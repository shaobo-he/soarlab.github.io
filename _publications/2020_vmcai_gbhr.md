abstract: "<p>
Developers nowadays regularly use numerous programming languages with different
characteristics and trade-offs. Unfortunately, implementing a software verifier
for a new language from scratch is a large and tedious undertaking, requiring
expert knowledge in multiple domains, such as compilers, verification, and
constraint solving.  Hence, only a tiny fraction of the used languages has
readily available software verifiers to aid in the development of correct
programs.  In the past decade, there has been a trend of leveraging popular
compiler intermediate representations (IRs), such as LLVM IR, when implementing
software verifiers.  Processing IR promises out-of-the-box multi- and
cross-language verification since, at least in theory, a verifier ought to be
able to handle a program in any programming language (and their combination)
that can be compiled into the IR.  In practice though, to the best of our
knowledge, nobody has explored the feasibility and ease of such integration of
new languages.  In this paper, we provide a procedure for adding support for a
new language into an IR-based verification toolflow.  Using our procedure, we
extend the SMACK verifier with prototypical support for 6 additional languages.
We assess the quality of our extensions through several case studies, and we
describe our experience in detail to guide future efforts in this area.
